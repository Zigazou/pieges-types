*******************************************

This is a test generator which takes as input ABNF grammars (as
specified in IETF RFC 4234) and produces strings matching that
grammar. This can be useful to test a grammar or to check a parser
you've written (see the scripts in compare/ for examples).

It is written in Haskell (http://www.haskell.org/). To run it, you
need an Haskell compiler or interpreter (only ghc,
http://haskell.org/ghc/, has been tested now). Then, type "make" to
build the program.

To use it, you have the following programs:

* abnf-parse: parses a grammar, check its syntax and that all rules
  are defined. Displays a compiled view of the grammar.

* abnf-generate: parses a grammar, check its syntax and that all rules
  are defined and generates text from the production named
  "start". You can change the production's name with the "-s" option.

It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence
(GPL) version 2.

Bug reports, patches, advices and criticisms are welcome.
